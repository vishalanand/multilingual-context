## Multi-lingual context on sparse datasets

The Multi-Clutser Embeddings created for 59 languages were reduced into two dimensions via the code in the project(process_embeddings.py) and then proceeded to dynamically view the data pasted into [this editable excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ndNXEMrekWBqraIInvAXW27RIXtkdlXiWoW7IhM_QaM/edit#gid=0), 
(One may update this sheet and the graphs change on refreshing)
Also, for larger window: go to [sparse-multilingual-context](http://vishalanand.net/sparse-multilingual-context)

On hovering, the last two elements in the popup are "word":"language". 
The legend at the top of the graphs can be used to toggle the corresponding words off and on from the graphs!
