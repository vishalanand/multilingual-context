## Multi-lingual context on sparse datasets

Multi-Clutser Embeddings for 59 languages reduced to 2-D via code in project(process_embeddings.py) and proceeded to dynamically view the data pasted into [this editable sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ndNXEMrekWBqraIInvAXW27RIXtkdlXiWoW7IhM_QaM/edit#gid=0) 
(One may update the sheet and graphs change on refreshing). On hovering, last 2 elements in popup are "word":"language". Legend at top of graph can toggle the corresponding words off/on!
Also, for larger window: go to [sparse-multilingual-context](http://vishalanand.net/sparse-multilingual-context)
